# Analysis Methodology

This document describes the methodology used in analyzing DDW research trends.

## 1. Data Collection

### Web Scraping
- Automated collection of abstracts from DDW conference website
- Years covered: 2018-2023
- Data extracted includes title, abstract text, author information, and presentation date
- Error handling and rate limiting implemented to respect website policies

### Data Validation
- Verification of data completeness
- Removal of duplicate entries
- Standardization of institution names and geographical information
- Validation of date formats and required fields

## 2. Text Processing

### Abstract Cleaning
- Conversion to lowercase
- Removal of special characters and excessive whitespace
- Standardization of medical terminology
- Basic spell checking and correction

### Feature Extraction
- Word count calculation
- COVID-19 related content detection
- Research category classification
- Geographical information extraction

## 3. GPC-4 Neural Network Analysis

### Model Architecture
- Base model: Pre-trained transformer architecture
- Additional layers for research trend analysis
- Output: 128-dimensional trend encoding

### Training Process
