# StanfordDDWPaper
This research  aims to analyze data sets from gastrointestinal (GI) publications in Digestive Disease Week (DDW) publications and examine the changes that have occurred over the past 5-6 years. Specifically, the paper investigates the increase in abstract publications and how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced this trend. To accomplish this, a program utilizing the GPC-4 Neural Network is developed to scan through the data, sort and filter the relevant information, and identify any discrepancies or differences. The study extracts useful data from 5 years and organizes it into an Excel spreadsheet for further analysis using multi-variable statistics. The paper also explores the potential of using the GPC-4 Neural Network as a research assistant to assist in data extraction and analysis, thereby addressing medical and cultural disparities or biases in research. The overall goal is to identify and analyze trends observed in DDW meetings over the past 5 years. Additionally, this research paper aims to provide insights into the implications of the observed trends and their potential impact on the field of gastroenterology. By examining the increase in abstract publications, the paper seeks to understand the evolving research landscape and identify emerging areas of interest within GI research. The investigation into how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced this trend will shed light on the adaptability of researchers and the prioritization of topics relevant to public health challenges. Furthermore, the development and utilization of the GPC-4 Neural Network as a tool for data analysis present a novel approach to improving research efficiency and addressing potential biases. By exploring the capabilities of this technology, this study strives to contribute to the advancement of equitable and rigorous research practices.
